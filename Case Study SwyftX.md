## Overview and Origin <a name="Overview"></a>

SwyftX Pty Ltd was incorporated in 2019 by founders Alex Harper and Angus Goldman.

Having first met during a University of Sydney Computer Science Camp when they were highschoolers they bonded, and their friendship blossomed. Together they developed the idea to launch an Australian based cryptocurrency exchange platform that would rival the existing systems by delivering better functionality, zero inflation, real spreads and simple low fees and later quit their jobs to establish SwyftX. Alex and Angus were able to self-fund the start up of SwyftX by joining their life savings [(SwyftX, 2021)](https://swyftx.com/au/about/).

## Business Activities <a name="Business"></a>

SwyftX has been built to fulfil the high demand for a liquid cryptocurrency exchange that adheres to Australian cryptocurrency regulations and tax system. 
Further to this the platform has strong security bosting 2 factor authentication and for secure API integration it has JWT tokens with session expiry.  

The SwyftX platform is targeted at new and expert traders that want to use an exchange specifically tailored for the Australian region. It is also pushing into the superfund space by offering users the ability to set up a self-managed super fund in the cryptocurrency market [(Boyd,2022)](https://finty.com/au/crypto/swyftx-review/).

In 2022 the Australian cryptocurrency exchange market exceeded $61 million by revenue, having grown by nearly 51.8% over the previous 5 years and with an expectation that it will see 13.7% of growth over 2022 [(IBIS World, 2022)](https://www.ibisworld.com/au/market-size/cryptocurrency-exchanges/).

Recently SwyftX became the first Australian based cryptocurrency exchange to offer 'cryptocurrency staking' allowing account holders to hold certain currencies for a reward of up to 20% per year. Staking is supported by some cryptocurrencies to better secure their networks [(Rose, 2021)](https://stockhead.com.au/cryptocurrency/crypto-news-77m-now-staked-on-swyftx-half-day-after-launch-saxo-expands-crypto-products/).

Prior to the recent inclusion of staking to their features SwyftX is known for having one of the largest number of available currencies for trade in Australia and still maintaining one of the lowest spreads and transaction fees amongst their Australian exchange competitors [(Chan, 2022)](https://www.marketplacefairness.org/au/cryptocurrency/swyftx-review/).

Accorning to [(crunchbase, n.d.)](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/swyftx/technology) Swyftx uses 17 technology products and services including HTML5, Google Analytics, and jQuery. Swyftx is actively using 50 technologies for its website. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone / Mobile Compatible, and SPF.

## Landscape <a name="Landscape"></a>

Alt et al. (2018) offers 3 defined FinTech Subdomains: 
* BankTech - Banking
* InsurTech - Insurance
* RegTech - Regulations
This can be further broken down as per the below Figure (Fig. 2) from the same article

![Figure of Domains](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs12525-018-0310-9/MediaObjects/12525_2018_310_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp)
[Image Source: Alt, Beck, & Smits, 2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-018-0310-9)

Although this is a changing filed, we can consider SwyftX to be in the "FinTech - BankTech - High Frequency Trading - cryptocurrency" domain as it facilitates the massive and instant transfer of cryptocurrency Ownership between parties [(Alt, Beck, & Smits, 2018)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12525-018-0310-9).


The first recognized cryptocurrency transaction between two people occurred on January 12 2009. Since then the world has seem rapid adoption with the first exchange (Bitsamp) being set up in 2011. Today there is almost more cryptocurrency exchanges than can be easily counted, the largest one globally being Binance [(bit2me, 2022)](https://academy.bit2me.com/en/history-exchanges-bitcoin-trading/#:~:text=Here%20begins%20the%20history%20of,%2C03%20BTC%20for%20%24%201). 



Some other notable exchanges commonly used in Australia include:

- **Coinspot** – Well known Australian cryptocurrency exchange
- **Digital Surge** – New Australian crypto platform with great team
- **CoinJar** – Oldest Australian crypto exchange
- **Binance** – Best cryptocurrency trading platform for advanced users
- **Independent Reserve** – Great Australian exchange for OTC purchases
- **Coinbase** – Biggest international crypto exchange for beginners
- **Coinmama** – International crypto broker with great payment options
- **eToro** – Best for CFD crypto trading
- **Kraken** – Best secure international exchange

[(Kemp, 2022)](https://coinformant.com.au/best-crypto-exchanges/)

## Results <a name="Results"></a>

SwyftX is often ranked as the "best exchange" among various review websites, one example is [(Kemp, 2022)](https://coinformant.com.au/best-crypto-exchanges/). This is normally because of their strong mix of: high number of supported currencies, easy user interface, and low fees. Although they do not lead in any of these categories this mix makes them a strong contender. Further to this SwyftX has a strong innovation culture, for example their recent introduction of cryptocurrency staking as discussed earlier in this article.

Although there are a number of important metrics to consider in the ranking of crypro exchanges, the key metric is as always market share by revenue. Their Current estimated revenue by year is $35.5M [(Growjo, n.d.)](https://growjo.com/company/Swyftx).

Based on [IBIS World, 2022](https://www.ibisworld.com/au/market-size/cryptocurrency-exchanges/) the cryptocurrency exchange market in Australia is worth $61M by revenue which puts SwyftX as the leader in the Australian market with 58% market share.

## Recommendations <a name="Recommendations"></a>

SwyftX is performing extremely well in Australia especially considering how recently they opened their digital doors. Despite their rapid growth there are 3 key recommendations for further market dominance.

1. **Margin Lending**

Many exchanges already offer margin lending, and is a key component to all major global trading platforms globally. Notably among cryptocurrency trading platforms Binanace already has this offering. SwyftX has already began development on this [(Matt B, n.d.)](https://help.swyftx.com.au/en/articles/4468833-does-swyftx-offer-leverage-trading#:~:text=We%20don). Once completed it will likely further their adoption by expert traders and increase their revenue, and add an additional revenue stream form the lending interest. 

This could be implemented by means of blockchain smart contracts, such as offered by Ethereum blockchain. This would easily enable and automate control of the lending contracts, which would be critical considering the significant admin of margin lending which is highly linked to the user’s trading performance and the value lent must often be adjusted to suit performance. Further to this AI could be used to assess individual users for their lending evaluation before granting any loans. Both functions would ordinarily be extremely difficult to administer manually considering their already large and growing user base, as such the ability to administer automatically is critical.

2. **Blockchain Shared Ownership**

Although this is not a widely adopted concept yet, it is possible to sell ownership of SwyftX in the form of a company created blockchain. The result of this is much the same as the current system of public share ownership done through centralised exchanges normally managed at the national level for example the ASX. Many blockchains already offer rewards for staking, a similar mechanism to this can be used for the purpose of dividend distribution. Incorporating a form of smart contract could be used for company shareholder voting and similar required company functions. This type of share ownership is described in detail in [Panisi et al, 2019.](https://stanford-jblp.pubpub.org/pub/blockchain-and-public-companies/release/1) 

This form of public offering can be used for significant capital fund raising thus allowing SwyftX to further explode their growth. 

3. **Globalisation**

By implementing recommendation number 2 SwyftX could use the additional funding to rapidly expand their operations globally. Their presence is currently only in Australia and New Zealand and has so far seen massive growth and adoption due to their excellent offerings. The additional capital will enable rapid and massive global expansion projects which could utilise technologies such as automated translation to break through language barriers.

This will be particularly important for expansion as the global market is approximately USD $1.6 Billion (AUD $2.1 Billion) [(Markets and Markets, n.d.)](https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/cryptocurrency-market-158061641.html) as of 2021 where the Australian market is only AUD $61 Million.
