Having first met during a University of Sydney Computer Science Camp when they were highschoolers they bonded, and their friendship blossomed. Together they developed the idea to launch an Australian based cryptocurrency exchange platform that would rival the existing systems by delivering better functionality, zero inflation, real spreads and simple low fees and later quit their jobs to establish SwyftX. Alex and Angus were able to self-fund the start up of SwyftX by joining their life savings [(SwyftX, 2021)](https://swyftx.com/au/about/).

## Business Activities <a name="Business"></a>
* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

SwyftX has been built to fulfil the high demand for a liquid cryptocurrency exchange that adheres to Australian cryptocurrency regulations and tax system. 
Further to this the platform has strong security bosting 2 factor authentication and for secure API integration it has JWT tokens with session expiry.  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

The SwyftX platform is targeted at new and expert traders that want to use an exchange specifically tailored for the Australian region. It is also pushing into the superfund space by offering users the ability to set up a self-managed super fund in the cryptocurrency market.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Recently SwyftX became the first Australian based cryptocurrency exchange to offer 'cryptocurrency staking' allowing account holders to hold certain currencies for a reward of up to 20% per year. Staking is supported by some cryptocurrencies to better secure their networks.

Prior to the recent inclusion of staking to their features SwyftX is known for having one of the largest number of available currencies for trade in Australia and still maintaining one of the lowest spreads and transaction fees amongst their Australian exchange competitors. https://www.marketplacefairness.org/au/cryptocurrency/swyftx-review/

SwyftX is often ranked as the "best exchange" among various review websites, one example is (https://coinformant.com.au/best-crypto-exchanges/). This is normally because of their strong mix of: high number of supported currencies, easy user interface, and low fees. Although they do not lead in any of these categories this mix makes them a strong contender. Further to this SwyftX has a strong innovation culture, for example their recent introduction of cryptocurrency staking as discussed earlier in this article.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

## Recommendations <a name="Recommendations"></a>

SwyftX is performing extremely well in Australia especially considering how recently they opened their digital doors. Despite their rapid growth there are 3 key recommendations for further market dominance.

1. **Margin Lending**

Many exchanges already offer margin lending, and is a key component to all major global trading platforms globally. Notably among cryptocurrency trading platforms Binanace already has this offering. SwyftX has already began development on this (https://help.swyftx.com.au/en/articles/4468833-does-swyftx-offer-leverage-trading#:~:text=We%20don). Once completed it will likely further their adoption by expert traders and increase their revenue, and add an additional revenue stream form the lending interest. 

This could be implemented by means of blockchain smart contracts, such as offered by Ethereum blockchain. This would easily enable and automate control of the lending contracts, which would be critical considering the significant admin of margin lending which is highly linked to the user’s trading performance and the value lent must often be adjusted to suit performance. Further to this AI could be used to assess individual users for their lending evaluation before granting any loans. Both functions would ordinarily be extremely difficult to administer manually considering their already large and growing user base, as such the ability to administer automatically is critical.

2. **Blockchain Shared Ownership**

Although this is not a widely adopted concept yet, it is possible to sell ownership of SwyftX in the form of a company created blockchain. The result of this is much the same as the current system of public share ownership done through centralised exchanges normally managed at the national level for example the ASX. Many blockchains already offer rewards for staking, a similar mechanism to this can be used for the purpose of dividend distribution. Incorporating a form of smart contract could be used for company shareholder voting and similar required company functions. 

This share distribution can be used for capital fund raising thus allowing SwyftX to further explode their growth. 

3. **Globalisation**

By implementing recommendation number 2 SwyftX could use the additional funding to rapidly expand their operations globally. Their presence is currently only in Australia and New Zealand and has so far seen massive growth and adoption due to their excellent offerings. The additional capital will enable rapid and massive global expansion projects which could utilise technologies such as automated translation to break through language barriers.

This will be particularly important for expansion as the global market is approximately USD $1.6 Billion (AUD $2.1 Billion) as of 2021 where the Australian market is only AUD $61 Million.
